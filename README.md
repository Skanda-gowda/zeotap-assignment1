## Features

- **Editable Spreadsheet**: Edit a dynamic spreadsheet with customizable rows and columns.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform operations like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and COUNT over specified cell ranges.
- **Data Quality Functions**: Trim whitespace, change case (UPPER/LOWER), remove duplicates, and perform find-and-replace operations.
- **Font Styling**: Customize font size, color, and style (italic, bold) for specific cell ranges.
- **Preview Styled Spreadsheet**: Visualize the styled spreadsheet with improved contrast and aesthetics.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate bar charts based on spreadsheet data.
- **File Handling**: Save spreadsheets to and load spreadsheets from Excel files.

## Tech Stack

### 1. **Streamlit**
   - **Why**: Provides a fast, efficient way to create interactive, data-driven web applications with Python.
   - **Usage**: Handles the front-end rendering, interactivity, and user interface of the application.

### 2. **Pandas**
   - **Why**: Offers robust data manipulation and analysis capabilities.
   - **Usage**: Manages spreadsheet data, applies data quality functions, and performs mathematical operations.

### 3. **NumPy**
   - **Why**: Efficiently handles numeric operations and supports mathematical calculations.
   - **Usage**: Ensures smooth operations for numeric computations in the spreadsheet.

### 4. **Data Structures**
   - **DataFrame** (Pandas):
     - **Why**: Provides a tabular structure that closely resembles a spreadsheet, making it an ideal choice for this project.
     - **Usage**: Stores and manipulates spreadsheet data dynamically, ensuring compatibility with mathematical and data quality operations.
   - **Dictionary**:
     - **Why**: Lightweight and efficient for storing styles associated with specific cell ranges.
     - **Usage**: Maps font styles (size, color, etc.) to cell ranges for applying custom formatting.

### 5. **Matplotlib (via Streamlit Bar Charts)**
   - **Why**: Offers built-in support for data visualization with simple integration.
   - **Usage**: Renders bar charts for visualizing column-wise data summaries.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dynamic Spreadsheet Editing**:
   - Achieved using Streamlitâ€™s `st.data_editor`, allowing users to interactively edit spreadsheet cells.

2. **Mathematical Operations**:
   - Designed a helper function (`perform_operation`) to calculate aggregates over cell ranges. 
   - Handled cell referencing by mapping column letters (e.g., A, B) to DataFrame indices.

3. **Font Styling**:
   - Used custom HTML rendering for styling specific cell ranges.
   - Incorporated support for bold, italic, and dynamic font sizes/colors.

4. **Data Quality Functions**:
   - Implemented reusable functions to clean and process spreadsheet data (e.g., trimming, case conversion, and duplicate removal).

5. **File Handling**:
   - Integrated support for reading and writing Excel files using Pandas for persistent storage of spreadsheet data.

6. **User Interface**:
   - Optimized the UI with dark-mode aesthetics, improved cell visibility, and a responsive layout.
